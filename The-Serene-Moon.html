<divclass=Exposition1> <h1>Don't Read This Out Loud</h1> </divclass>
  <divclass=exposition> <p>As you walk through the entrance, a pale ,blue, moon light begins emitting throughout the chamber and the diagrams of the moon phases appear to shift and move lazily across the stone. On the opposite side of the chamber you see a statue of a beautiful women inlaid into 
  the stone, from which the moonlight appears to be originating from. Her empty stone eyes, alight and seem to be looking directly at you. 
  <hr>
    "Do not react, it is imperitive that your companions remain unaware", a disembodied voice echoes around you. The voice is comforting, like a mother talking to a child. 
    <br>
    "I am not certain you know me by name however you have been following my teachings, and walking the path of a Moon Walker. I am Eldra, the Goddess of the Moon, the light in the dark, and the serene embrace."
    <br>
    "There is an artefact being held by a nefarious group in the depths of my temple. They have warped the halls of my sanctuary into a twisted and blited domain of coruption."
    <br>
    "I ask of you to purge this evil, and collect this artefact"
    <br>
    "Your companions will be of much importance to you in the upcoming conflict however I ask that you do not inform them of the importance of the artefact....", there is a slight pause.
    <br>
    "Perhaps the follower of the stars can be of use ... otherwise I ask that you maintain discretion in this matter with the others."
    <br>
    "I will provide you further instructions once this is complete. Be brave my child, follow the guidance of the sacred text in your possesion and you will be successful"
    <br>
    Suddenly the comforting light dims along with the warmth of your goddess's voice, and the temple returns to it's decrepted state, leaving you only with the instructions Eldra has provided.
